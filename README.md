## About the Video Course
This course is designed to make you an expert in AWS machine learning and it teaches you how to convert your cool ideas into highly scalable products in a matter of days.The biggest challenge for a data science professional is how to convert the proof-of-concept models into actual products that your customers can use. There are several courses on machine learning that teach you how to build models in R, Python, Matlab and so forth. However, converting a model into a scalable solution and integrating with your existing application requires a lot of effort and development. The real success of your ideas and concepts depends on how soon you can put the capabilities in the hands of your customers.With the AWS Machine Learning service, you can easily conduct experiments and test your concepts. Once you are happy, you can instantly scale them to support millions of requests. No separate development work is needed.
